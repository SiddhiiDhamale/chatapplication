Chat App Made using Flutter and firebase .With Basic features like search User and log out activity.
**features**

2.Firebase to fetch user information in-order to search the user by using query-snapshots.
Firestore to create a chatRoom for each user.
3.Allows user to send and receive messages to multiple user.

Messaging is the basic feature in majority of applications this is reason I wanted to know the basics behind the working of chat applications.
More flutter provides great user interface with ease , wanted to explore that as well.
